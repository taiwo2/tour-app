<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this project I have developed a single page application for a Hospital with react and redux libraries. App name is BHAKTI HUSADA Hospital. A user can sign up/login to see the details of doctors and book an appointment.

App uses react router to route to different components. 
Backend APIs are developed with Ruby on Rails. [Click here](https://github.com/taiwo2/appointment-backend.git) to see backend project details.
